# Omni

## Overview
Omni is a multi-module application featuring a Java backend and TypeScript/React frontend. It provides a game platform with authentication, core game logic, and an interactive client interface.

## Requirements
- Java 21
- Node.js 18+
- Docker (for databases)
- Gradle 8.0+

## Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://gitlab.com/omni6961018/Omni.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd Omni

# Build the backend
./gradlew build

# Setup the client
cd client
npm install
```

## Usage
### Running the Backend
```bash
# Start all backend services
./gradlew bootRun

# Start specific module
cd auth
../gradlew bootRun
```

### Running the Frontend
```bash
# Navigate to the client directory
cd client

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

### Using Docker Compose
```bash
# Start all services
docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

## API Reference
The Omni API is organized into several modules:

### Auth Service
* `POST /login` - Authenticate a user
* `POST /register` - Register a new user
* `GET /logout` - Logout current user
* `GET /me` - Get current username

### Game Logic API
* `* /game` - Start websocket connection for the game

## Architecture
Omni follows a modular architecture:

- **auth**: Authentication and user management
- **core**: Shared core functionality and utilities
- **gameLogic**: Game rules and state management
- **client**: Frontend React/TypeScript application
